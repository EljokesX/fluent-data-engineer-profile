### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### OAuth Configuration

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to Authentication → Settings → External OAuth Providers
3. Enable Google and GitHub providers:

**Google OAuth setup:**
1. Create OAuth credentials in the Google Cloud Console
2. Set the authorized redirect URI to: `https://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
3. Add Client ID and Client Secret to Supabase

**GitHub OAuth setup:**
1. Register a new OAuth application in GitHub Developer Settings
2. Set the authorization callback URL to: `https://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
3. Add Client ID and Client Secret to Supabase

### Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Set up the following tables:

**profiles table**
```sql
create table profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users primary key,
  email text,
  role text default 'guest',
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now())
);

-- Set up RLS policies
alter table profiles enable row level security;

create policy "Users can view their own profile"
  on profiles for select
  using (auth.uid() = id);

create policy "Admins can view all profiles"
  on profiles for select
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid() and role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

**projects table**
```sql
create table projects (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  title text not null,
  description text not null,
  category text not null,
  year text not null,
  image text not null,
  technologies text[] not null,
  demoUrl text,
  githubUrl text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now())
);

-- Set up RLS policies
alter table projects enable row level security;

create policy "Projects are viewable by everyone"
  on projects for select
  to authenticated, anon
  using (true);

create policy "Projects can be inserted by admins"
  on projects for insert
  to authenticated
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid() and role = 'admin'
    )
  );

create policy "Projects can be updated by admins"
  on projects for update
  to authenticated
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid() and role = 'admin'
    )
  );

create policy "Projects can be deleted by admins"
  on projects for delete
  to authenticated
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid() and role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

**contact_messages table**
```sql
create table contact_messages (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  email text not null,
  message text not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now())
);

-- Set up RLS policies
alter table contact_messages enable row level security;

create policy "Messages can be inserted by anyone"
  on contact_messages for insert
  to authenticated, anon
  using (true);

create policy "Messages can be read by admins"
  on contact_messages for select
  to authenticated
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid() and role = 'admin'
    )
  );

create policy "Messages can be deleted by admins"
  on contact_messages for delete
  to authenticated
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles
      where id = auth.uid() and role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

### Create an Admin User

1. Sign up a new user through the application interface
2. Go to your Supabase dashboard > Authentication > Users
3. Find the user you want to make an admin
4. Go to your Supabase dashboard > SQL Editor
5. Run the following SQL to promote the user to admin:

```sql
update profiles
set role = 'admin'
where email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Navigate to project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Install dependencies
npm i

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Production Build

```sh
# Create production build
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

## How to use Lovable?

The best way to use Lovable is to not ask for too much at once. For example, if you want to create a new feature, don't ask for the whole thing at once. Try to break it down into smaller steps.
